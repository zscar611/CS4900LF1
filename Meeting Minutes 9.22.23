MEETING NOTES:

Members present: Everyone
Duration: 11:27-11:53

-Client requests a check-in service for volunteers at the Kalamazoo location. 
The volunteers will provide their information to the front desk worker, who enters their information into a form. 
The information will be entered into a database which tracks volunteer hours, and, while the volunteer is checked-in, 
their location within the building (or if they are out of the building/on the road). 
Possible locations include: Front Desk, Pantry, Case Worker, Warehouse(Gen,Delivery,Group,Super), Special Event, Call Center, Mailings

-A different possibility is to put a QR code near the front desk; 
volunteers would scan the code and fill out the form on their phones. However, client is unsure if this is desirable, 
citing the relatively high average age of volunteers possibility that volunteers enter incorrect information.

-Client prefers we build standalone app instead of adding a webpage to the Loaves and Fishes site, 
but would also like the option to integrate it at a later date.

-Volunteers can access the app on their phones and log-in to view their schedule/accumulated hours.

-Additionally, the client requests an interface for managing employee schedules
